        <p class="p2">In my book design class for my print and publishing course, I was tasked to redesign the cover of a book in three other genres of my choosing. In my case, I chose to work with the book called “You Are A Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life” written by Jen Sincero which of self-help and motivational genre, and I redesigned it as Romantic Comedy novel, a Cookbook, and an autobiography. </p>

        <h2 class="p2 bold"> PROCESS</h2>
        <p class="p2"> My first cover is a romantic comedy in which I chose to do because the in some parts of the book, the tone is of humorous and cliche nature. Based on my research, a common colour scheme amongst romantic-comedy books are on the lighter side. They often have bright or pastel shades of colours such as red, pink, blue, and yellow which is why I tried to incorporate the same concept. In terms of typeface, romantic comedy books also have some sort of decorative type on the page, in combination with some type of sans serif. Lastly for imagery, there is often some style of illustration on the cover, so I drew a female with a cape to represent the heroic sense of self that the book promotes to readers. </p>
